 * differently for different databases. However, since the capabilities of
 * a database can change between versions, it is recommended that
 * conditional code is in terms of capabilities methods in
 * {@link Dialect}.
 *
 * <p>Because there are so many differences between various versions and
 * ports of DB2, we represent them as 3 separate products. If you want to
 * treat them all as one product, note that the {@link #getFamily()} method
 * for {@link #DB2_AS400} and {@link #DB2_OLD_AS400} returns {@link #DB2}.
